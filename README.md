Use above link to download Server and Client.

This should work on Local Host without any additional configuration. Across computers on the same network or across the Internet, you will need to use port forwarding.
This game uses port 23492.

Run OnlinePokemonServer.jar first which will start the Server and display the local host address.

Then run OnlinePokemonClient.jar. A dialogue will ask for your name and then for your opponent's name. Your name needs to match with the opponent's name of the other client and vice versa. Then it will ask for the host address which will be either the local host address or the IP address the server is running on.

Then the rest should be straight forward.

You can scroll on a mouse wheel or with two fingers on a touchpad to increase/decrease the screen size.
